This is a Sublime Text (2) plugin to add support for Puppet syntax highlighting.
It's basicly a fork from Brice Figureau's puppet-textmate-bundle repository with a few changes to make it work in Sublime Text (2).

I do not wish to take any credit for his (and others') hard work.

Snippets aren't supported yet at this point.
